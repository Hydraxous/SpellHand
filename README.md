# SpellHand
SpellHand is a mod that implements a visual overhaul of spellcasting. It adds a left hand which adorns your equipped magic rings.
The spell hand is animated and has many different animations depending on the spell. Animations can be configured in the AnimationMapping.txt file where the mod dll is located.

The mod also disables the crosshair for spells, if you want to stop this behavior you can disable it in the Bepinex/config for the mod.

You can customize the target animation for each spell by modifying AnimationMapping.txt file in the SpellHand folder.
